## React Fundamental Concepts Used in the Project
This project utilizes several key React concepts, including:
- **Components**: Reusable building blocks (functional components) for the UI.
- **Props**: Used to pass data and event handlers down to child components.
- **State**: Managed using the `useState` hook to handle dynamic data.
- **Effect Hook**: `useEffect` is used for side effects, such as data fetching.
- **Routing**: React Router is used to handle navigation between different pages/components.
- **Context API**: Used for global state management, particularly for the shopping cart and wishlist functionalities.

## Data Handling and Management
For handling and managing data in this project:
- **Context API**: Utilized for state management across different components, specifically for managing the shopping cart and wishlist.
